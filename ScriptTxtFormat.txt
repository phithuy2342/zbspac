Format of script.txt:

The first line (header) of the file is like:

ZBSPAC-TRANSLATION ENCODING japanese COUNT   812

The 'japanese' is the encoding of the translated text when they are packed into
a new binary script file. You can and should change it. (If your target
language is English, then maybe you can ignore this. ;)

zbspac accept the same locale strings accepted by C's setlocale function,
and yes, this string is sent directly to a setlocale() call.

If you are unfamiliar with something like "encoding", just put your language
name here(in English, of course), like 'chinese', 'korean', and usually it
will work.

(By 'work', I mean the texts will be 'stored' correctly, not 'displayed'
 correctly. For the game to display your texts, more steps should be taken.)

The number after 'COUNT' (812 in this case) is the number of text segments
extracted. DO NOT change this.

The lines following the header are data entries for text segments.

The format is as follows:

SEG [segment serial number] NULL [number of nulls following this segment]
The original text.
------------------
The translated text. (initially the same as original)

The only part you should be changing is "The translated text." The length of
this line is not restricted, but do put the translation in one single line.

There are some control codes in the game scripts. Proceed with caution. But I
don't think they are too hard to figure out, no? ;)

[Simplified Chinese Here!]

script.txt的格式：

文件的首行（文件头）形似：

ZBSPAC-TRANSLATION ENCODING japanese COUNT   812

其中“japanese”是翻译后的文本在打包回二进制脚本时所用的编码，除非是翻译英文，
否则这个字段几乎总是要改的，既然你看到这段了，那一般改成“chinese”就行了xD~

注意这可不会自动让你的游戏显示中文哦~

“COUNT”后面的数字是解包得到的文本段数，*不要*修改。

而后就是很多个文本数据段了，格式为：

SEG [序列号] NULL [本段文本后面的空字符数]
原始文本
------------------
翻译后文本（最初和原始文本是相同的）

唯一应该修改的就是“翻译后文本”，文本长度不限，但必须写在一行里面。

游戏脚本中有一些控制字符，请不要乱改，不过，我觉得要理解这些符号并不很难，
是吧？;)
